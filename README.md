		Call me like uh any of the anmes on my guestbook. it/its preference, but I like he/they too (no she/her, ty.) :3 


		Basic DNI, Tallyshippers (Id hope no ponytown players are Tally shippers...?), 
	phighting & Regretevator (strictly1!), im not rlly strict about anythign else lol .I never hide ppl
 	Systems interact with atleast some caution...  Its just bc its hard for me to interact w systems nothin personal </3

				Things im like really interested in
		Tally hall (and Cojum dip i love cojum di), Objectified, Michael Vey, 
  	Omori, Faith the unholy trinity, uh the fazbear frights books SPECIFICALLY the second one idk... I didnt read the other ones and I didnt like the 
  	first one so..............Im not in the fnaf fandom nor do I consider myself a fan though lol (Nothing
   	towards fnaf fans I just dont really have an interest in fnaf anymmoorrreee + I do like the games
    but I am not in the fandom I just like silly robiot.... sihj...........) MSI 
 	uh idk I dont like a lot of things (Im not rlly in any fandoms so I guess it wouldnt rerally matter)
	   		(Sorry this is hard to read)
      
 	Im not mean... I swear..... I like having converssyionds
	
	If my status is like away I really am, I will reply late to whispers lol (And I wont reply to public measges at all.. 
 	Unless I like just came back from being afk) If I have busy on it might br bc im offtab (completely or patrially)
	or I dont really wanna interact w anyone but friends, sorry... (I dont rlly put like DNI in my name mostly
 	bc im lazy and I know ppl arent going to listen (Not saying that people interact w me a lot but its happened) 

	If you interact t with me I miggghhht be mean bc i need to warm up to ppl before I actually want to have a conversation
 	w/ someone but i dont bite.... I swear (im desperate can you tell
	Im usually at the fnaf area (Whether I have a fnaf skin or not,) Sometimes near the Phighting area (Ik its on my dni but Im not actually
 	IN the area + no1 there talks to me anyway so it doesnt matter </3), and anywhere else its either bc Im trying smt new, have a pony
  	from a fandom im in, or sitting w a friend idk
